% Test of some routines from linuxCNC source code to interpolate splines
% Check of spline construction integrity
% Spline from P0 to P3 with interior points P1,P2 as waypoint/node/knot

% SPLINE_FEED with 6 input arguments require as input
% the control points of a B-Spline. P0 and P3 are as well
% use as first and last control points, however, only
% [P1,P2,P3] are passed to SPLINE_FEED as arguments.

% P1 and P2 define the shape of the spline
% There are four shape parameters P1x, P1y, P2x, P2y
% Likely the x-grid is always uniform from 
% P0123 = P0+[0 1/3 2/3 1]*(P3-P0)];

% x0,y0 Start point, stored in class property _pos_x and _pos_y
%
% Spline defition in Bezier format. Arguments of SPLINE_FEED 
% y1 first coeff of cubic B-Spline
% y2 second coeff of cubic B-Spline
% y3 third coeff of cubic B-Spline

% x0,y0 first control point on outer polygon = Start point P0
% x1,y1 second control point on outer polygon = P1
% x2,y2 third control point on outer polygon  = P2
