Use of simple polynominal and B-Splines in GNU Octave and Matlab for geometrical shape approximation

The objective are simple spline approximations of common geometric shapes with potential practial use in CNC machining.
Interest is on spline interpolations with a low number of parameters, describing common shapes such as circles, ellipses,
squares, slots, pockets and contours of arbitrary shape.

Mapping of spline parameters to dimensions of the geometrical entities is welcome.
Conversion of parameters between different types of splines is part of adaption to the 
broad varyity of commercial and home-made hobbist CAD-CAM-CNC systems.

Splines are used in the CAD to define the geometry, in the CAM to define the tool path, and in the
CNC control system, to interpolate spline to a dedicated set of G-commands.
